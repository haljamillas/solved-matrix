ObjectiveThe objective of this problem is to ensure that students know how to use 2 dimensional array and simple looping technique.Problem DescriptionGiven a 2 dimensional array of size N x M containing 1 or 0 and a query (ROW or COLUMN), determine the sum of the numbers in the array corresponding to the query. For example, query “ROW 3” means sum all the elements in the 3rd row of the array.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers, N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100) and M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 100). The next line is an array with size N x M. The next line is the query with format “ROW x“, (1 &lt;= x &lt;= N) or “COLUMN y”, (1 &lt;= y &lt;= M).OutputOutput the answer to the query.Sample Input4 51 0 1 0 10 1 0 1 01 1 1 0 10 0 1 0 0ROW 3Sample Output4Explanation1 0 1 0 10 1 0 1 0ROW 3 1 1 1 0 10 0 1 0 0The sum of numbers in row 3 is 4
